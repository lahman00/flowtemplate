/**
 * ROAD TO THE FIRST 1,000 REAL HUMANS mission (2026-08-22) — extracted
 * from scripts/social/schedule.ts (previously a manual-only CLI script,
 * never wired to any cron) so app/api/cron/social-schedule/route.ts and
 * the CLI can share one implementation, the same relationship
 * runPublishCycle already has with app/api/cron/social-publish/route.ts
 * and scripts/social/publish.ts. This was found to be the single biggest
 * acquisition-pipeline gap: the publish cron ran reliably 4x/day but
 * could only ever consume SCHEDULED entries, and nothing but a human
 * remembering to run this script promoted APPROVED_FOR_AUTO -> SCHEDULED
 * — 2,436 fully-QA'd, ready-to-publish posts sat completely unscheduled.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY: identical to runPublishCycle's — this only ever reads
 * entries currently in APPROVED_FOR_AUTO and immediately transitions any
 * it touches to SCHEDULED in the same write, so a second invocation
 * (e.g. two cron ticks close together) finds a strictly smaller
 * candidate pool each time and can never double-schedule the same entry.
 * No entry can be scheduled twice, and nothing here ever publishes —
 * that stays runPublishCycle's job, gated by its own separate CRON_SECRET
 * check and per-channel-per-day caps. No distributed lock is needed for
 * the same reason runPublishCycle doesn't need one: Vercel Cron invokes
 * a route serially, not as a long-lived overlapping process.
 *
 * CADENCE: paces entries at the minimum cadence among ENABLED channels
 * only (bluesky/mastodon are disabled — see data/social/social-strategy.json
 * — so as of this mission that's effectively facebook(7/wk) and
 * linkedin(3/wk), giving a conservative 1/day pace) — never dumps the
 * backlog, matches the "start conservative to avoid spam signals"
 * principle already documented in social-strategy.json.
