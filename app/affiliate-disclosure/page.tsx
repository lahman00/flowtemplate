              An ordinary vendor link is not described as an affiliate link. Affiliate status

              We do not label a link as an affiliate link unless it actually is one, and we do
              not disguise affiliate links as ordinary links. A commercial relationship does
              not mean that a vendor sponsored the page, reviewed its copy, or paid for its
              placement.
