/**
 * Manual single-entry publish trigger (2026-08-21). runPublishCycle()
 * (the Vercel Cron path, app/api/cron/social-publish/route.ts) is built
 * for the automated content-engine cadence: it only fires LinkedIn inside
 * its one deliberate 17:00 UTC daily window (lib/social/publish.ts,
 * runPublishCycle's skipChannels logic). There was previously no way to
 * publish one specific, already-approved, manually-drafted queue entry
 * on demand — a real gap for an urgent, owner-directed post that can't
 * wait for the next automated window.
 *
 * This route deliberately bypasses ONLY that cadence/pacing heuristic —
 * every real safety mechanism stays in force: it still calls the same
 * publishOneEntry() the cron path uses (same adapters, same LinkedIn
 * readiness gate in lib/social/linkedin-readiness.ts, same durable
 * dedup claim in lib/social/linkedin-delivery-claims.ts, same
 * providerState/queue persistence as runPublishCycle). It only ever
 * touches the ONE entry named in the request body — never scans for due
 * work — and requires the entry to already be in state SCHEDULED (i.e.
 * deliberately queued for delivery, not an arbitrary draft).
 *
 * Gated by its own secret (SOCIAL_MANUAL_PUBLISH_SECRET), independent of
 * CRON_SECRET, so this route's exposure is scoped to whoever holds this
 * specific credential — same fail-closed pattern as the cron route.
